## Expression simplifier
Something that will simplify expressions at compile time will greatly simplify implementaiton!

For instance: string.Format(Format, GetStableFunction()); will be easily analyzed to
string.Format("{0}{1}", 1); if Format is a const and GetStableFunction() is a constant function!
(OK, function simplification is a next step, but for many cases it would be very helpful!)
